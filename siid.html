   <h4>Linear Equations</h4>

   <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>

   <h3><b class="H">ax + b = 0</b></h3>
   <p>where <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are real numbers and <i>x</i> is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear <span>equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <i>x</i></span> so don’t get too locked into always seeing an <i>x</i> there.
   </p>
   <h4>Quadratic Equation</h4>

   <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>

   <h3><b class="H">ax^2 + bx + c = 0 </b></h3>  

   <p>where <i>a, b, c</i> are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, <i>a</i> can't be 0.</p>

   <b>The area of a circle (A)</b>

   <p> <i>&#960;</i> (Pi) times the radius (<i>r</i>) squared:</p>

   <h3><b class="H">A = &#960; &#215; r<sup>2</sup></b></h3>  

   <p>or, when you know the diameter (<i>D</i>):</p>

   <h3><b class="H">A = (&#960/4) &#215; D<sup>2</sup></b></h3>

   <p>or, when you know the circumference (<i>C</i>):</p>

   <h3><b class="H">A = C<sup>2</sup>/ 4 &#215; &#960;</b></h3> 

   <h4>Intersection</h4>

   <p>The intersection of two sets <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, denoted by A &#8745; B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,</p>

   <h3><b class="H">A &#8745; B = { x : x &#8712; A and x &#8712; B }</b></h3>  

   <p>That is, <i>x</i> is an element of the intersection A &#8745; B if and only if <i>x</i> is both an element of <i>A</i> and an element of <i>B</i>.</p>
